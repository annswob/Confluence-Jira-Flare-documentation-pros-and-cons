# **Techwriter Wannabe Reads Documentation : Jira, Confluence and MadFlare Cap Overview**

:books: What keeps an aspiring technical writer awake at night? For me, it is definitely the overwhelming amount of new tools to learn. After years of simply typing into a text editor, I woke up in the world filled with terms such as: authoring solutions, single-sourcing and content reuse. In times like this, reading technical documentation can be a life saver: not only does it help to grasp the concept of these tools, but it also allows to compare the pros and cons of given products. So, letâ€™s take a closer look at the documentation of three popular solutions: **Jira**, **Confluence** and **Madflare Cap**.

## Jira & Confluence
:books:
As both of these tools come from the Atlassian family and the organization of their documentation is very similar, I decided to analyze them together in order highlight their similarities and differences. 

1. First glance  

Logging to [Confluence](https://techcommvistula.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TECHCOMMVI/overview) for the first time, we can see a **Quickstart** menu on the right:

It does not give much information, but it is useful as an introduction.  

Jira does not have this feature: instead, it suggests you a few articles that you can read directly in the **Help** panel and then evaluate their usefulness:

I think a more detailed **Quickstart** menu would be a good idea in both cases, just to give us a general overview of the most important functions.

1. Online help  

In order to find detailed documentation for both tools, we need to click on the question mark button at the top right-hand corner: its visibility and accessibility is a big plus. From here, we can go to (both in Jira and Confluence):  
* [Read help articles](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/resources/): this section is divided into a series of articles with mini-presentations embedded in the text. What I liked about them is that they are written in a simple, fun language and provide step-by-step instructions.  
* [Ask the community](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence/ct-p/confluence): another self-help feature, providing answers to specific questions asked by users.  
* [What's new](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog): a section containing changes and updates to the tools.  

But what I found the most interesting in this documentation is somewhat hidden: the **Atlassian University** courses. Nowhere to be seen in the Confluence **Help** menu, this feature can be found in Jira:
